   - Name and description
   - When to use this expert
   - Specialised prompt
   - Model configuration

```

### Context Management

Configure how the agent maintains conversation context:

- **Customer Context**: Access to customer profile and history
- **Session Management**: How long to maintain context
- **Memory Persistence**: What information to remember long-term

### Response Formatting

Control response format and structure:

```markdown
# Response Format
Structure your responses as follows:
1. Acknowledge the customer's question
2. Provide the main answer or solution
3. Offer additional help or next steps
4. End with a friendly closing

Use bullet points for multiple items.
Include relevant links when helpful.
```

## Testing and Validation

### Test Scenarios

Create comprehensive test scenarios:

1. **Happy Path**: Standard customer inquiries
2. **Edge Cases**: Unusual or complex requests
3. **Error Handling**: Invalid inputs or system errors
