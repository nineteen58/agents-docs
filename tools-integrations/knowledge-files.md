# Knowledge Files

Knowledge Files provide a powerful way to enhance your AI agents with custom information, documents, and data sources. This system allows you to upload, manage, and assign knowledge files to specific agents for improved context and accuracy.

## Overview

Knowledge Files provide:
- **Document Upload**: Support for various file formats and document types
- **Content Processing**: Automatic text extraction and indexing
- **Agent Assignment**: Assign knowledge files to specific agents
- **Search Integration**: Knowledge files are automatically searched during conversations
- **Version Management**: Track and manage different versions of knowledge files
- **Organisation**: Organise knowledge files by category and purpose

## How It Works

### File Processing
When you upload a knowledge file:
1. **File Upload**: Document is uploaded to secure storage
2. **Content Extraction**: Text content is extracted from the document
3. **Indexing**: Content is indexed for fast retrieval during conversations
4. **Agent Assignment**: File is assigned to specific agents
5. **Search Integration**: Content becomes available during agent conversations

### Knowledge Retrieval
During conversations:
1. **Query Analysis**: Agent analyzes the user's question
2. **Knowledge Search**: Relevant knowledge files are searched
3. **Content Retrieval**: Matching content is retrieved from files
4. **Context Integration**: Knowledge is integrated into the response
5. **Response Generation**: Agent generates informed response using knowledge
