# Prompts

Prompts are the foundation of your AI agents' behavior and personality. The Prompts system allows you to create, manage, and reuse structured prompt templates that define how your agents communicate and respond to users.

## Overview

Prompts provide:
- **Structured Templates**: Organised prompt templates with consistent structure
- **Personality Definition**: Define agent personality, tone, and communication style
- **Goal-Oriented Design**: Set clear goals and objectives for agent behavior
- **Guardrail Implementation**: Define safety and compliance boundaries
- **Tool Integration**: Specify which tools and capabilities agents can use
- **Reusability**: Create prompts that can be used across multiple agents

## How It Works

### Prompt Structure
Each prompt template contains:
- **Personality**: The agent's character and communication style
- **Tone**: How the agent should communicate (professional, friendly, etc.)
- **Goal**: The primary objective the agent should achieve
- **Guardrails**: Safety rules and compliance requirements
- **Tools**: Which tools and capabilities the agent can use
- **Full Prompt**: The complete, formatted prompt for the agent

### Prompt Processing
When creating an agent:
1. **Template Selection**: Choose from existing prompt templates
2. **Customisation**: Modify the template for specific use cases
3. **Agent Assignment**: Assign the prompt to specific agents
4. **Dynamic Integration**: Prompts are dynamically integrated into agent responses
5. **Context Adaptation**: Prompts adapt to conversation context and user needs
